# PencilDurability-Kata

 Hi- This is my code kata for Pillar Technologies. I chose to do the pencil durability code kata. I created a .net core project and wrote my application in C# 

# To Run tests: 
1. Clone my code from my Git repository: https://github.com/MeridithJunk/PencilDurability-Kata
2. To ensure all relvent dependencies are added run  'dotnet restore' from the command line in your solution folder
3. To build run 'dotnet build' from the command line in your solution folder
3. Open up the command line and go to: {your project directory}\CO.PencilDurability\PencilDurabilityTests
4. Run 'dotnet test' on the command line
