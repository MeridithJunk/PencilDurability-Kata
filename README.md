# PencilDurability-Kata

 Hi- This is my code kata for Pillar Technologies. I chose to do the pencil durability code kata. I created a .net core project and wrote my application in C# 

# To Run  my tests 
1. Clone my code from my Git repository: https://github.com/MeridithJunk/PencilDurability-Kata
2. run dotnet restore to ensure all Nuget Packages have installed 
3. Open up the command line and go to: {your project directory}\CO.PencilDurability\PencilDurabilityTests
4. Run 'dotnet test' on the command line
